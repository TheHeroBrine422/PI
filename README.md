# PI

Messing around with various PI formulas. Used a few resources for this to make it easier to deal with. Didn't keep track of them all but got the original formulas from wikipedia.

chudnovskyPiDecimal() requires a modified version of Decimal that has higher precision limits. You need to set LN10_PRECISION and PI_PRECISION to higher values. I set mine to 1e100 in the copy included in node_modules.
